Efficient inventory management is the backbone of any successful warehouse operation. When dealing with large inventories, the ability to quickly store, retrieve, update, and 
delete product information becomes essential. This is where data structures and algorithms play a pivotal role. The right data structure ensures that these operations can be 
performed efficiently, even as the inventory grows to thousands or millions of items.

For a warehouse inventory system, each product can be uniquely identified by a product ID. The operations we care most about are adding new products, updating details of existing 
products, deleting products, and quickly finding a product by its ID. Using a simple list (like an ArrayList) means searching for a product by ID would require checking each item 
one by one, which is slow for large inventories. On the other hand, a HashMap allows us to associate each product ID with its product details, making lookups, updates, and 
deletions extremely fastâ€”almost instant, regardless of the inventory size.

Therefore, for a warehouse inventory system where speed and scalability are crucial, a "HashMap" (or similar key-value data structure) is the best choice. 
It enables efficient management of products and ensures the system remains responsive as the business grows.
