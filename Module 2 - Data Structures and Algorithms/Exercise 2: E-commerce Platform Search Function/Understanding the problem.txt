When building a search function for an e-commerce platform, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that users can find products quickly, even as the number of products grows. 
This is where understanding asymptotic notation, especially Big O notation, becomes important.

Big O notation is a way to describe how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases. It helps us compare different algorithms 
and predict how they will perform as the dataset becomes larger. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that if you double the number of products, 
the time it takes to search will also double. An O(log n) algorithm, like binary search, grows much more slowly with input size, making it more efficient for large datasets.

When analyzing search algorithms, we often talk about three scenarios:

Best-case: The fastest possible outcome (e.g., the product is found immediately).

Average-case: The expected time for a typical search.

Worst-case: The slowest possible outcome (e.g., the product is last in the list or not present at all).

Linear search checks each product one by one. Its worst-case time is O(n), meaning it may need to look at every product. Binary search, on the other hand, 
works on sorted data and repeatedly divides the search space in half. Its worst-case time is O(log n), which is much faster for large arrays. Thus, using the right algorithm 
and data structure is critical for a fast, scalable search experience on an e-commerce platform.
