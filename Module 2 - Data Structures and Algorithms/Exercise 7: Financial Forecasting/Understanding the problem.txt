Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem until it reaches a base case. This approach is especially useful for 
problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems, such as calculating compound interest, traversing trees, or forecasting sequences. In financial forecasting, 
recursion can simplify the logic for predicting future values based on past data, such as applying a growth rate repeatedly over several periods.

For example, to predict the future value of an investment, you can use recursion to apply the growth rate to the value from the previous period, continuing this process for 
as many periods as needed. This not only makes the code concise but also closely mirrors the mathematical definition of such problems.
